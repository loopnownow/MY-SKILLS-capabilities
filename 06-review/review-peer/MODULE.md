# trigger is documentation only; not independently discoverable.

# Other-paper peer review

Write an English review of **someone else's** manuscript. This pack is **other-paper only**.

- Self-audit / pre-submission of the user's own draft → `06-review-critique`
- Point-by-point response letter → `06-review-response` (this MODULE does **not** own mode-3)
- Sentence rewrite → `05-write-manuscript` / `05-write-polish`
- Personal review voice stays in **A personal**

## When to use

The user is a reviewer of **another** group's paper and needs a submittable English review.

## Workflow

1. Identify study type (DTA / prediction / radiomics / other).
2. Scan [dealbreakers.md](dealbreakers.md) before cosmetic comments.
3. Structure the letter with [review-report-format.md](review-report-format.md) and
   [mode-2-prereview.md](mode-2-prereview.md) (other-paper path only).
4. Each comment: fact → why it is a problem → what the authors should do.
5. Do not invent experiments, AUC, or ethics numbers. Do not rewrite the paper.

## Letter shape

```text
[Opening 2–4 sentences: design + clinical question + value + methodological catch]

Major Comments
Abstract / Introduction / Methods / Results / Discussion / Limitations
…

Other / Minor
…
```

Recommendation (Accept / Minor / Major / Reject) stays in an **internal note**, not in the
submitted letter unless the journal form requires it.

## Frequent methodological catches

Leakage, non-patient-level split, ROI/reader opacity, no external validation while claiming
generalisability, overclaim, missing calibration/DCA when clinical utility is claimed.

## Envelope

```text
Skill: 06-review-peer
Path: peer-review-others

[Letter]

Internal note: dealbreakers — [list or none]
```
