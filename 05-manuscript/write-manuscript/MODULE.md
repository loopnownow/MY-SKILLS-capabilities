# Generic IMRAD manuscript draft

Draft and revise **scientific prose** (Title / Abstract / Introduction / Methods / Results /
Discussion). This pack is **generic IMRAD only**.

**Not in this pack (stay in A personal, or other B ids):**

- Personal house format / title-page defaults
- de-AI forbidden lists and detectors
- Lab ethics IRB wording and author-line defaults
- Language polish → [`05-write-polish`](../write-polish/MODULE.md)
- Venue house style / article shape → [`05-write-venue`](../write-venue/MODULE.md)
- 选刊 / where to submit → A `03_research` (journal-selection) / B `03-lit-search`
- TRIPOD / CLAIM / CLEAR checklists → [`05-write-reporting`](../write-reporting/MODULE.md)
- Self-audit → `06-review-critique`; other-paper review → `06-review-peer`; response → `06-review-response`

## When to use

- Draft or rewrite IMRAD sections from supplied facts
- Keep observational language (`associated with`) unless the design supports causation
- Export a Methods skeleton from `methods_template_export.md`

**Do not use this module** for polish-only passes, 选刊, or 回复审稿人.

## Hard rules

1. Numbers stick to assertions (n, AUC, CI, *P*); no empty claims
2. Introduction: problem → guideline definition → gap → approach (`radiology-writing/introduction.md`)
3. Observational designs: *associated with*, not causal verbs
4. Consistent terms; expand abbreviations at first use
5. Introduction and Discussion sentences run 10–30 words, one main proposition each; no run of short sentences (a personal layer may override)
6. Do not invent results, citations, ethics numbers, or unrun experiments
7. Missing facts → comments / open questions, never fabricated body text
8. Patient-level split language when the study is predictive
9. Dual-set reporting when the user supplied both training and test metrics
10. Reporting guidelines (TRIPOD, CLAIM, CLEAR) are not named in the Introduction; route to `05-write-reporting`
11. Related studies are synthesized, not listed: at most one triplet per paragraph, no repeated sentence frames
